Fermi–Pasta–Ulam simulation: Oscillations on a string afixed at both ends with some nonlinearity applied. Red curve shows linear simulation with no nonlinearity applied (note that the "linear" string develops some oscillations, presumably due to numerical error).

Controls:
1/2:		Decrease/increase "stride", that is, the number of frames to calculate between drawings.
